Real-time Messaging:
The chat application uses Socket.IO for real-time messaging between the client and the server. Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.

Theming Adaptation:
The chat application supports light and dark themes using React context and CSS variables.


How to run:

-cd server->npm start(runs nodemon server.js, runs http on localhost:4000)

-cd client->npm start(runs react server on localhost:3000)
